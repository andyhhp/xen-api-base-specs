For every component, you can do:

comp-extract
comp-configure
comp-build
comp-fake
comp-clean

...or just a top-level 'build' or 'clean' to do them all.

To add a new component:

- add entry into Makefile

- create a component.mk file

This has the following variables: DISTFILES (to find sources), OBJDIR
(for building), DESTDIR (for installing into), and PREFIX (in main
file-system).

This file uses a few stamps which are self-explanatory: EXTRACTED,
PATCHED, BUILT, and CONFIGURED.  FAKE is the final one which should
install the package into DESTDIR/PREFIX so that it can be tarred up.

A makefile can set PATCHES= which applies the files (found in patches/)
after extraction.
